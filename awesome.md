# BitCanna tools and other useful links
> Important note for the [Validators Incentive Program](https://docs.bitcanna.io/token-chain-parameters/validator-incentive-program) participants: the files applicable for the [services](https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/docs/blob/main/tools/available-tools.md) and [endpoints](https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/bcna/blob/main/chain-registry.json) will be used to determine the delegations. So it is of the utmost importance to keep the files updates and the services running to be eligible for delegations.
> As prerequisite for you to get a delegation, you need to keep your validation services updated at our local [JSON file](https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/bcna/blob/main/chain-registry.json)

Find the links towards all the services and tools which are delivered by our team or from our amazing validators documented **[here on Github](https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/docs/blob/main/tools/available-tools.md)** or **[here on Gitbook](https://docs.bitcanna.io/tools/available-tools)**.

Note that these pages do not contain RPC, gRPC, API, seed nodes and more. These are stored on another location. 
As a validator you can create a pull request to update our **[JSON file](https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/bcna/blob/main/chain-registry.json)** and we will use that to upgrade the [Cosmos Chain Registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/) from time to time.
