# Install / Compile last BitCanna binary 
**bcnad** is a blockchain application built using Cosmos SDK v.0.45.1 and Tendermint v.0.34.15.

In this guide you will find how to install the last binary or compile it by yourself.

* Before you start, you might want to ensure your system is up to date. Besides, you can install a utility named `jq` to read and navigate in JSON files and outputs.

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential curl wget jq
    ```
* Increasing the default open files limit.
If we don't raise this value, nodes will crash once the network grows large enough.
    ```
    sudo su -c "echo 'fs.file-max = 65536' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
    sudo sysctl -p
    ```
## Option 1. Download and install the last binary 
By downloading the binary we avoid compiling the source code.
1. Download the latest version (v.1.3.1) from Github:
    ```
    cd $HOME
    wget -nc https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/bcna/releases/download/v.1.3.1/bcnad
    chmod +x bcnad
    sudo mv bcnad /usr/local/bin/
    ```
2. Check for the right version (1.3.1): 
    ```
    bcnad version
       >>> response: 1.3.1
    ```
    
3. Check the sha256sum by security & integrity. 
    ```
    sha256sum ./bcnad
    ```
    It must return: `ad6784e945135454efc436d22a7661db36bc6a396e7d9cdb7572c4d8d5ccef3f`


## Option 2. Compile instructions: 
### Install GoLang

1. Install Go 1.17.x 
The official instructions can be found [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

2. First remove any existing old Go installation as root
    ```
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
    ``` 
3. Download the software:
    ```
    curl https://dl.google.com/go/go1.17.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -C/usr/local -zxvf -
    ```
4. Update environment variables to include go (copy everything and paste)
    ```
    cat <<'EOF' >>$HOME/.profile
    export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    export GO111MODULE=on
    export GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOBIN
    EOF
    source $HOME/.profile
    ```
5. To verify that Go is installed:
    ``` 
    go version
    ```
    Should return `go version go1.17.7 linux/amd64`

### Download source code and compile
1. Download the source code using `git`
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/BitCannaGlobal/bcna.git
    cd bcna
    git checkout v.1.3.1
    make build   #it build the binary in build/ folder
    ```
2. To know the version:
    ```
    build/bcnad version
    ```
    The output must be `.1.3.1`

3. Is the versi√≥n match, now you have two options
* Move the binary to the /usr/local/bin path with: 
    ```
    sudo mv build/bcnad /usr/local/bin/
    ```
* Compile and install the binary in the $GOPATH path:  
    ```
    make install
    ```
